Demo Application
================

A fully functional demo application is included to showcase the features of this library. To try it out:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/otto-torino/django-editor-js.git
        cd django-editor-js

2. **Run the demo:**

    - **On Windows:**

      .. code-block:: batch

          run_demo.bat

    - **On macOS / Linux:**

      .. code-block:: bash

          ./run_demo.sh

This will set up a minimal Django project, create a database, and start the development server so you can explore the editor in action.
